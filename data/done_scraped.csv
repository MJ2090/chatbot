You would need to find a psychiatrist through a Yelp or Google search and hope you find someone with experiencing diagnosing or treating ADHD in your area. Then you'd give them a call and hope they pick up the phone or give you a call back. If you’re able to get in touch with them, their appointments within your availability may be booked weeks or months out, or you may need to take time off work because none of their appointments fit within your schedule. You then need to remember to attend the appointment, fill out forms and sit in a waiting room, then spend time speaking with a psychiatrist hoping that they take your symptoms seriously. There’s so many steps in this process that are further complicated if you have insurance. We're a technology company that works with licensed psychiatric clinicians who are vetted to have experience with diagnosing and treating ADHD. Simply book an appointment on our website and click a link when it's time for your appointment. Medication is handled easily and as a member and you'll always have access to your provider and our care team in managing your treatment.
